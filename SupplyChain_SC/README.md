Smart contract deployed on Rinkeby testnet

Transaction hash : 0x708067b93465ecf1ce8282e707723154cf018f7ccd16b4b2b2a900bf95aabc82

install npm i lite-server@2.4.0 and run : npm run dev to access the smart contract via the front end


(version number used :
Truffle v5.5.3 (core: 5.5.3)
Ganache v7.0.1
Solidity v0.5.16 (solc-js)
Node v16.13.0
Web3.js v1.7.1)

Why have I used those libraries ?

1) Truffle : Truffle was one of the first framework to appear and thus, documentation is comprehensive and tutorials are easily available. On top of that, it also has a big supportive community, thus make debugging and asking questions easy using blogs, medium, discord server, Stackoverflow and Stackexchange. Github repositories are constantly updated and bugs are worked on on very fast pace. The truffle team automated contract testing which make it easy to test.

2) Web3.js : Web3.js is open source and thus great mind from all over the world can participate to the extension of this tool. However it does also mean that there is no clear directions on what should be implemented first or in what order. With Web3.js Github repositories and libraries being constantly updated, it looks like it is keeping up to date with the industry, getting rid of bugs and following Javascript updates (which it uses). In conclusion it easy to use, widely utilize in the industry and well up to date, which make a good contender to be used as a library to connect with Ethereum nodes.
